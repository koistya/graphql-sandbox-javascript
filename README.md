### Getting Started

Before you can launch the GraphQL server and automated test suite, you development
environment should meet the following criteria:

  * Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux operating system
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v5.0, or newer (for running tests)
  * ...

To launch the server, run the following command in your terminal or console window:

```sh
$ ...
```

After launching the server, the [*GraphiQL* IDE](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)
should become available to you at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

To start the automated test suite, run:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm test
```
